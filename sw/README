DEBUGGING
---------

To debug the MIDI stream we dump it to the host machine by setting the
UART on the device to 9600 baud and reading the TTY and piping through
hexdump.

To build a debug build with UART set to 9600, do the following:

	$ CFLAGS=-DDBGDUMP make prog

Then to dump the stream to the terminal:

	$ make dumpstream
